## Overview

Candle Cove is a **documented work of fiction**—a creepypasta story written by Kris Straub and published on his Ichor Falls website in 2009. The story is formatted as an internet forum discussion where users remember a disturbing children's TV show from the 1970s called "Candle Cove," featuring a puppet cast including the sinister Skin-Taker, only to discover that children watching the show saw the program while adults only saw static.

**THIS IS FICTION WITH A KNOWN AUTHOR**. Despite the realistic format and some people claiming to remember the show, Candle Cove never aired. The story's brilliant use of nostalgic false memory and creepy imagery led many to believe it was real. The shared-memory format makes it feel authentic, but Kris Straub created it entirely as horror fiction.

Candle Cove became one of the most influential creepypastas, inspiring the Syfy series "Channel Zero: Candle Cove" (2016) and numerous copycats. It exemplifies **effective internet horror through false nostalgia**.
